# Squid-x-Compound-v2-Rates-Predictor


<b>Rationale</b>    
The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is transforming traditional financial systems by enabling transparent and efficient financial transactions on blockchain. Among the prominent protocols, Compound V2 allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. However, the dynamic interest rates for supply and borrow operations depend heavily on market conditions, which makes predicting them crucial for maximizing returns and minimizing risks. Initially, this project relied on GizaTech's dataset to build predictive models. Now, by leveraging Squid's SDK to gather real-time blockchain transaction data from tokens like WBTC and USDT, the dataset has been significantly enriched, leading to improved prediction performance. This real-time data incorporation addresses the need for accurate, timely predictions, giving users a competitive edge in managing DeFi investments.


<b>The Solution</b>    
Squid Rate AI combines advanced machine learning models with enriched blockchain datasets to predict supply and borrow rates on Compound V2. Using GizaTech's Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) framework, the solution enhances privacy while ensuring accurate predictions. By integrating Squid's SDK, Squid Rate AI leverages real-time blockchain data on WBTC and USDT transactions, which enriches the dataset and enables more precise forecasting. These predictions allow users to make informed decisions, optimize their portfolios, and manage risks in the ever-evolving DeFi market. Squid Rate AI offers reliable insights, supporting users with predictive analytics that leverage both historical and real-time data.


<b>Value Proposition</b> 
Squid Rate AI provides DeFi users with accurate predictions of Compound V2 supply and borrow rates by combining Compound v2 dataset with real-time blockchain data. The use of Squid's SDK to gather token-specific transaction data ensures that the predictions are more relevant and timelier. This enriched dataset enhances the precision of machine learning models, helping users optimize their lending and borrowing strategies. Whether for risk management, portfolio optimization, or algorithmic trading, Squid Rate AI empowers users to stay ahead of market fluctuations and make data-driven decisions that maximize their returns.
